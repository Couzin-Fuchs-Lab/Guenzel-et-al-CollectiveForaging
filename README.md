# Information integration for decision-making in desert locusts
Locust swarms can extend over several hundred kilometers, and starvation compels this ancient pest to devour everything in its path. Theory suggests that gregarious behavior benefits foraging efficiency, yet the role of social cohesion in locust foraging decisions remains elusive. To this end, we collected high-resolution tracking data of individual and grouped gregarious desert locusts in a 2-choice behavioral assay. Animals had to decide between patches of either different or similar quality, and we reliably predicted their decisions by employing a Bayesian formalism taking the accumulation of personally acquired and socially derived evidence into account. By disentangling the relative contribution of each information class, our study suggests that locusts balance incongruent evidence but reinforce congruent ones. We provide insight into the collective foraging decisions of social (but non-eusocial) insects and present locusts as a powerful empirical system to study individual choices and their consequent collective dynamics.
